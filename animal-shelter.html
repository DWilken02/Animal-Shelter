    <p> Ahhh dogs. A Mans best friend. You know almost everybody love dogs including myself. Not only are they loving but they are also very loyal if trained and treated well. They are also great comfort pets for if you are feeling sad or depressed. Some dogs depending on the breed can even be certified therapy or service dogs for those who are in need of either a therapy or service pet with the proper training of course. If you are a dog lover and are wanting to adopt one then here is a list of our currently available breeds:</p>

     <p>Cats are mans second best friend. They can range from hairless to completely fluffy. I myself currently have 2 cats living in my house. You know one of a cats best traits is how resourceful they and like dogs they too can be service animals. They can also be really good mousers if you want an outdoor cat. If you are a cat lover and are wanting to adopt one then here is our selection of cat breeds:</p>
    </div>
   <div class="cats-list">
    <ul>
      <li>American Bobtail</li>
      <li>Japanese Bobtail</li>
      <li>Ragdoll</li>
      <li>Orange Tabby</li>
      <li>Grey Tabby</li>
      <li>Black Tabby</li>
      <li>Siamese</li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   
   <div class="Lizards-title">
   <h2>Lizards:</h2>
   </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Species: Reptile</li>
      <li>Traits: Ranges from big to small, very good sense of smell, can use tongues to catch fragrance particles in the air.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Lizards I think are some of the most interesting reptiles that I can think of. In fact they are closely related to snakes given that some lizard species have snake like tongues. Don't worry the lizards we have here arent deadly.</p>
